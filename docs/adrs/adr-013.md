# ADR 013: UI Design based on Sketches

## Date

2023-11-25

## Status

Active

## Context

During the UI development process, the utilization of pre-existing sketches significantly influences design decisions. These sketches, created through tools (Excalidraw, Mockitt), serve as the initial visual representation of UI elements and guide subsequent design iterations.

## Decision

We will base our UI design decisions on pre-existing sketches created with tools like Excalidraw. This decision entails:

- **Sketch Review**: Thoroughly reviewing and analyzing previously drafted sketches to derive design elements and patterns.
- **Iterative Design**: Iterating and refining UI designs based on the insights and concepts from the pre-existing sketches.

## Consequences

The reliance on pre-existing sketches for UI design will result in the following outcomes:

- **Consistency in Design:** Utilizing established sketches helps maintain visual consistency throughout the UI.
- **Efficient Design Process:** Building upon pre-existing concepts accelerates the design process, reducing iteration time.
- **Clarification and Alignment:** Existing sketches aid in clarifying design intent, fostering better alignment within the development team.
- **Adjustments and Adaptations:** Some adjustments might be required during the transition from sketches to actual implementation due to technical considerations.
