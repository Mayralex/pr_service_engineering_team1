## Status

Active

## Context

The dashboard requires a visualization library to create interactive and informative visualizations for ADR data. We evaluated three popular libraries: Chart.js, ngx-graph, and Vis.js.

## Decision

After careful evaluation, we have decided to adopt Vis.js as the primary visualization library for our dashboard due to its following strengths:

- **Extensive Configuration Options:** Vis.js provides a wide range of configuration options for tailoring visualizations to specific needs.

- **Support for Graph Visualizations:** Vis.js has native support for creating and customizing graphs, which is crucial for visualizing ADR relationships.

- **Flexible Data Handling:** Vis.js can handle various data types and formats, making it versatile for a variety of visualization scenarios.

## Consequences

Adopting Vis.js will have the following positive consequences:

- **Enhanced Visualization Customization:** Developers can create highly customized visualizations tailored to the dashboard's requirements.

- **Effective Data Visualization:** Vis.js's graph visualization capabilities will enable the creation of insightful representations of ADR relationships.

- **Scalability and Flexibility:** Vis.js can handle various data types and scales, ensuring compatibility with the dashboard's evolving needs.
