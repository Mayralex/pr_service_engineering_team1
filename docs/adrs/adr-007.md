# ADR 007: Deprecating the Message Service

## Date

2023-11-20

## Status
Active

## Context

The message service, previously implemented to display toast messages, has been deemed ineffective and detrimental to the user experience. Its excessive notifications, irrelevant content, and overall annoyance have outweighed its intended purpose of providing informative feedback.

## Decision

We have decided to deprecate the message service due to its negative impact on the user experience and development workflow.

## Consequences

Deprecating the message service will have the following positive consequences:

- **Improved user experience:** Users will be relieved from unnecessary and disruptive toast messages.
- **Enhanced development efficiency:** Developers will spend less time debugging and addressing issues related to the service.
- **Simplified codebase:** The removal of the message service will reduce code complexity and maintenance overhead.
- **Enhanced developer communication:** Developers can utilize more effective communication channels, such as console logs, for debugging purposes.
