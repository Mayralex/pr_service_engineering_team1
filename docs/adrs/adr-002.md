## Context

As our application grows in complexity, it's essential to establish a robust and organized approach to codebase management and project organization. This ADR outlines our decision to adopt GitHub as the primary code hosting platform and GitHub Projects for project management and issue tracking.

## Decision

We have decided to utilize GitHub and GitHub-Projects for the following reasons:

- **GitHub:**

    - Widely used and familiar to many developers, facilitating collaboration and knowledge sharing.
    - Provides a centralized repository for storing and managing the application's codebase.
    - Offers version control features, enabling tracking of code changes and rollbacks if necessary.
    - Supports access control mechanisms to manage access to the codebase.

- **GitHub-Projects:**

    - Integrated with GitHub, providing a seamless workflow for project management and issue tracking.
    - Enables creating and organizing project boards to visualize and manage tasks and workflows.
    - Facilitates issue tracking, allowing for creating, assigning, and tracking bugs and feature requests.
    - Supports milestone management, enabling setting and tracking project goals and timelines.

## Consequences

This decision will have the following consequences:

- **Positive:**

  - Improved codebase organization and maintainability.
  - Enhanced collaboration and communication among developers.
  - Effective project management and issue tracking.
  - Reduced risk of code conflicts and version control issues.

- **Considerations:**

  - Adoption of consistent coding conventions and documentation practices.
  - Regular maintenance of repositories, issue tracking, and project boards.
