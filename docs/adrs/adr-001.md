# ADR 001: Initial Technology Stack Decisions

## Date

2023-10-19

## Status

Active

## Context

As we embark on the development of our application, it's crucial to establish a foundation of robust and scalable technologies that align with our project's goals and requirements. After careful consideration, we have identified Java with Spring Boot for the backend and Node.js with Angular for the frontend as our preferred technology stack.

## Decision

We have decided to adopt the following technology stack for our application:

- **Backend:** Java and Spring Boot

  - Spring Boot is a popular Java framework that simplifies development and deployment. Its robust features, including dependency management, auto-configuration, and embedded web servers, make it an ideal choice for building scalable and maintainable backend services.

- **Frontend:** Node.js and Angular

  - Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that provides a lightweight and efficient platform for developing server-side applications. Its asynchronous, event-driven architecture makes it well-suited for handling real-time user interactions and building dynamic web applications. Angular, a popular TypeScript-based framework for building single-page applications (SPAs), offers a structured and component-based approach to frontend development, ensuring maintainability and scalability.

## Consequences

This decision will have several implications for our project:

- **Backend:**

  - Leverage Spring Boot's features to simplify backend development and deployment.
  - Benefit from a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools for Java development.
  - Invest time and effort in learning and adopting Spring Boot's conventions and best practices.

- **Frontend:**

  - Utilize Node.js's asynchronous and event-driven architecture for efficient real-time user interactions.
  - Build dynamic SPAs with Angular's structured and component-based approach.
  - Invest time and effort in learning and adopting Node.js and Angular's frameworks and methodologies.
