# ADR 011: Using GraphQL for Commit Information Retrieval

## Date

2023-11-20

## Status

Active

## Context

In our project, retrieving detailed commit information, such as commit messages, authors, timestamps, and associated changes, is crucial for various purposes like historical analysis. 
For our Dashboard, we aim to visualize the life cycle of an ADR, which is why we need to extract the timestamp from a commit, since the date is not included in every ADR template. Traditional REST APIs might have limitations in providing specific commit details efficiently.

## Decision

We will adopt GraphQL to fetch commit information from the version control system (Git) using the commit hash as a reference. This decision includes:

- **GraphQL Endpoint Setup**: Establishing a connection to the version control system's GraphQL API.
- **Query Definition**: Crafting a GraphQL query to retrieve commit details based on the commit hash.
- **Response Processing**: Handling and processing the received GraphQL response to extract necessary commit information.

## Consequences

By utilizing GraphQL for commit information retrieval, the project will benefit in the following ways:

- **Granular Information**: GraphQL allows tailored queries for specific commit details, avoiding unnecessary data retrieval.
- **Efficiency**: Retrieving commit information directly through GraphQL potentially reduces API call overhead and simplifies data extraction.
- **Flexibility**: As project needs evolve, GraphQL provides room for additional or modified queries without drastic changes.
