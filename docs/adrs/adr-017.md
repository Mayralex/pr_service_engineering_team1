# ADR 017: Backend restructuring - introducing ImportTask

## Date

2024-01-05

## Status

Active

## Context

The current controller lacks adherence to RESTful principles, leading to inconsistencies in API endpoints, request handling, and response formats. Enhancing REST-conformity will improve the predictability and usability of our API.

## Decision

To ensure adherence to RESTful principles, we propose refactoring the controller layer. This will involve restructuring endpoints, handling HTTP methods uniformly, and standardizing response formats.

- **GET-Request:** A get request should always deliver the same result, no matter how often it is sent. Query Parameters are sent in the header
- **POST-Request:** The parsing of ADRs requires a post-request, since an action is happening (ADRs are processed, analyzed and parsed). Query Parameters are sent in the body
- **Naming conventions:** The naming of endpoints (e.g. ADR/{id} to get an ADR by its id) should adhere to REST-rules
- **HTTP Status Codes:** Status Codes (like 404-Not Found) should be handled accordingly
- **Code Documentation:**Every endpoint should be documented, including its parameters and return value

## Consequences

Refactoring the controller to comply with RESTful principles will result in the following benefits:

- **Improved Predictability:** APIs will adhere to well-established RESTful standards, enhancing predictability for consumers.
- **Enhanced Usability:** Consistent endpoint structures and response formats will improve API usability for developers.
- **Scalability and Maintainability:**  A RESTful structure supports scalability and simplifies future maintenance.
