# ADR 010: Introducing a GitHub Actions Pipeline

## Date

2023-11-3

## Status

Active

## Context

As the project scales and involves multiple contributors, streamlining the development workflow becomes essential. Automating tasks like testing, linting, and deployment will enhance productivity and code reliability. GitHub Actions provide a flexible and integrated approach for automating these processes.

## Decision

We will implement a GitHub Actions pipeline to automate key aspects of the development workflow.
In a first step, only a build stage for building the project will be introduced. The built-tool we use is Maven, therefore a maven build is started as soon as a branch gets pushed to the repository. If the build is green (backend build was successful), the branch can be merged into main.

## Consequences

The introduction of GitHub Actions for workflow automation will result in the following benefits:

- **Efficiency**: Automating routine tasks saves time and effort for developers.
- **Consistency**: Ensuring code quality and reliability through automated testing and linting.
- **Visibility**: Providing a transparent view of the workflow status via GitHub's UI.
- **Scalability**: Facilitating the addition of more sophisticated processes as the project evolves.
