# ADR 014: Restructuring Backend for Consistent GitHub API Calls via GraphQL

## Date

2023-12-20

## Status

Active

## Context

In our backend architecture, calls to the GitHub API are presently made using various methods, resulting in inconsistency in data retrieval and processing. Introducing a unified approach, such as utilizing GraphQL for all GitHub API interactions, could streamline data fetching and processing.

## Decision

We will restructure the backend to standardize all interactions with the GitHub API using GraphQL. This decision includes:

- **GraphQL Implementation:** Introducing GraphQL queries for all data retrieval and modification operations involving the GitHub API.
- **Endpoint Standardization:** Updating existing backend endpoints to utilize GraphQL queries for GitHub API interactions.
- **Data Processing Consistency:** Ensuring uniform data processing mechanisms for responses obtained via GraphQL.

## Consequences

Implementing a consistent GraphQL approach for GitHub API calls in the backend will lead to the following outcomes:

- **Data Consistency:** Utilizing GraphQL ensures consistent data retrieval and formatting across various API interactions.
- **Reduced Complexity:** A unified approach simplifies code maintenance and reduces complexity by having a single API querying mechanism.
- **Efficiency in Development:** GraphQL's ability to request specific data minimizes unnecessary data retrieval, enhancing performance.
- **Learning Curve:** Team members may require training to adapt to GraphQL if not familiar with its syntax and usage.
