## Date

2023-11-02

## Status

Active

## Context

Establishing consistent and well-defined naming conventions is crucial for maintaining code readability, maintainability, and overall project organization. This ADR outlines our decision to adopt a standardized set of naming conventions and general guidelines, documented in a separate guidelines document within our shared project folder.

## Decision

We have decided to adopt a set of naming conventions and guidelines for our application and workflow to ensure consistency, clarity, and ease of understanding across the codebase. These guidelines are outlined in a separate document titled `Guidelines` located in our shared project folder.

## Consequences

Adopting these naming conventions will have the following positive consequences:

- Improved code readability and maintainability: Consistent naming conventions make it easier for developers to understand and modify code.
- Enhanced collaboration and communication: Standardizing naming practices facilitates better understanding and communication among team members.
- Reduced risk of errors: Consistent naming reduces the likelihood of introducing errors due to confusion or misinterpretation of variable or function names.
- Increased code reusability: Consistent naming promotes code reusability by making it easier to identify and utilize existing components.
