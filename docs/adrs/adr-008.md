# ADR 008: Refactoring ADR Service for Polling-based ADR Retrieval

## Date

2023-12-06

## Status

Active

## Context

The current adr.service implementation relies on retrieving all ADRs from the backend in a single request. However, due to the backend's processing time for parsing ADRs, not all ADRs may be available at the time of the initial request. This delay can cause issues when displaying ADRs, as incomplete or outdated data may be presented.

## Decision

To address this issue, we propose refactoring the adr.service to implement polling for retrieving ADRs from the backend. This approach involves making multiple requests to the backend at a predetermined interval until all ADRs are fully parsed and available.

## Consequences

Implementing polling will have the following positive consequences:

- **Real-time ADR display:** Users will have access to the most up-to-date ADR information, ensuring consistent and accurate data presentation.
- **Improved user experience:** Users will not experience delays or incomplete data when viewing ADRs, enhancing the overall user experience.
- **Reduced development effort:** Developers will no longer need to handle potential errors or inconsistencies arising from outdated ADR data.
