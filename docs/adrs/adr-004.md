# ADR 004: Angular Frontend Project Structure

**Date:** 2023-11-10

**Status:** Active

## Context

A well-defined project structure is essential for maintaining a maintainable, scalable, and organized Angular frontend. This ADR outlines our decision to adopt a structured approach, dividing the frontend codebase into three primary folders: components, interfaces, and services.

## Decision

We have decided to adopt the following project structure for our Angular frontend:

* **components:** This folder houses all Angular components, each represented by a separate subfolder. Each component subfolder contains the component's HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and Test files.

* **interfaces:** This folder contains TypeScript interface definitions for data entities used throughout the application. These interfaces provide type safety and structure for data exchange between components and services.

* **services:** This folder holds Angular services, responsible for handling data access, communication with external APIs, and business logic. Each service has its own TypeScript file.

## Consequences

Adopting this project structure will have the following positive consequences:

* **Improved code organization:** The structured layout separates components, interfaces, and services, making it easier to locate and manage code.
* **Enhanced maintainability:** The modular approach simplifies code maintenance by isolating components, interfaces, and services into distinct units.
* **Promoted code reusability:** Consistent organization and naming conventions facilitate code reuse across components and services.
* **Reduced risk of conflicts:** The structured layout minimizes the likelihood of code conflicts between components, interfaces, and services.
