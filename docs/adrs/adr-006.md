# ADR 006: Message Service Implementation and Usage

## Date

2023-11-12

## Status

Deprecated

## Context

Effective user communication is crucial for a seamless user experience. The message service plays a vital role in displaying toast messages, providing visual feedback and informing users of application actions.

## Decision

We have decided to implement the message service with the following responsibilities:

- **Display toast messages:** The service handles the creation and display of toast messages, ensuring consistent appearance and positioning across the application.
- **Manage message content:** The service manages the content of toast messages, including text, severity level, and duration.
- **Handle message queue:** The service maintains a queue of toast messages, ensuring that messages are displayed in the appropriate order.

## Consequences

Adopting this service design will have the following positive consequences:

- **Enhanced user communication:** Consistent and informative toast messages improve the user experience.
- **Reduced component complexity:** Components can focus on their primary functionality, delegating message display to the service.
- **Centralized message management:** The service provides a centralized location for managing message content and display rules.
- **Improved maintainability:** The service's well-defined responsibilities make it easier to understand, modify, and test.
