# ADR 005: ADR Service Definition and Responsibilities

**Date:** 2023-11-12

**Status:** Active

## Context

The ADR service is a critical component of the Angular frontend, responsible for fetching ADR information from the backend API. A well-defined service design ensures clear responsibilities, maintainability, and testability.

## Decision

We have decided to implement the ADR service with the following responsibilities:

* Fetch hero data from the backend API endpoint `/api/v2`.
* Transform and prepare ADR data for consumption by Angular components.
* Handle error responses from the backend API.

## Consequences

Adopting this service design will have the following positive consequences:

* **Clear separation of concerns:** The ADR service encapsulates data fetching logic, separating it from component presentation concerns.
* **Improved maintainability:** The service's well-defined responsibilities make it easier to understand, modify, and test.
* **Enhanced testability:** The service's isolated functionality facilitates unit testing and integration testing.
* **Reduced component complexity:** Components can focus on presentation and data binding, delegating data fetching to the service.
