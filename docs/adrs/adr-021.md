# ADR 021: Introducing Swagger UI

## Date

2024-01-10

## Status

Active

## Context
We identified a need for improved API documentation for this project to up-to-date information
of the API and easy testing.

## Decision

To address the goal of providing comprehensive documentation not only for our internal team but also for external
developers, we have introduced Swagger UI. This decision encompasses the incorporation of Swagger UI to 
dynamically document our REST API.

## Consequences

The introduction of Swagger UI will bring about several consequences:

- **Improved Documentation:** Swagger UI transforms our REST API documentation into a dynamic and interactive platform. 
    This empowers users to test and comprehend the API effortlessly, fostering a more user-friendly experience.
- **Enhanced consistency of documentation:** The integration of Swagger UI ensures that our REST API documentation remains in constant 
    sync with the actual state of the API. This significantly reduces the risk of inconsistencies and promotes accurate understanding.
- **Easy understanding of the API:** Swagger UI simplifies the comprehension of our REST API and its parameters. The interactive 
    interface provides an intuitive way for developers to explore and understand the intricacies of our API.
