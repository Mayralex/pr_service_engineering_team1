# ADR 009: Introduction of 'pipes' folder in Frontend Structure

## Date

2023-12-05

## Status

Active

## Context

As the frontend codebase grows, there's a need for a structured approach to manage and organize reusable transformation functions and filters across the application. 

## Decision

We will introduce a dedicated pipes folder within the frontend structure to contain all reusable Angular pipes. Currently, we have added a search.pipe into our 'pipes' folder, 
allowing the user to search for ADRs by title and status. Extracting the search pipe into the pipes folder allows us to use our pipe in multiple components. 

## Consequences

The introduction of the pipes folder will bring the following advantages:

- **Organized codebase**: Centralizing pipes in a dedicated folder enhances code readability and maintainability.
- **Reusability**: Developers can easily locate and reuse existing pipes across multiple components.
- **Scalability**: As the application grows, having a designated folder for pipes streamlines future additions and modifications.
