# ADR 012: Adoption of Bootstrap Library

## Date

2023-11-7

## Status

Active

## Context

In our frontend development, ensuring consistent and responsive design elements across the application is essential. Bootstrap, as a widely adopted CSS framework, offers a comprehensive set of components and styles that can expedite UI development. However, integrating an external library introduces dependencies and might affect customizability.

## Decision

We will integrate the Bootstrap library into our frontend development stack. This decision encompasses:

- **Library Integration**: Adding the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files to the project.
- **Component Utilization**: Utilizing Bootstrap's predefined UI components for consistent styling and layout.

## Consequences

The adoption of the Bootstrap library will result in the following outcomes:

- **Rapid UI Development**: Leveraging Bootstrap's components can expedite UI development tasks.
- **Consistency**: Ensuring a consistent look and feel across different parts of the application.
- **Maintenance Impact**: Possible adjustments required if Bootstrap's default styles conflict with custom design choices.
- **Increased File Size**: The addition of external CSS and JS files might increase initial load times.
